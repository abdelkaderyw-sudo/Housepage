        <h1>Arabic Proverbs: Language, Memory, and Meaning</h1>
        <h2>"In Arabic, we say.."</h2>
        <h3>Arabic proverbs are short sentences that carry memory, humor, grief, and wisdom.<br>
            They are spoken casually and mostly humorously yet many of them are rooted <br> in culture, religion, and everyday belief systems.</h3>
        <p>
            When Arabic proverbs are translated into Latin-based languages like English,<br>
            much of their meaning is lost because they are deeply embedded in cultural,<br>
            religious, and linguistic contexts that do not transfer cleanly across<br> 
            languages. Arabic relies on flexible sentence structures, rich morphology,<br> 
            and layered semantics, where meaning is shaped as much by tone, rhythm, and<br> 
            shared belief systems as by literal words. Many proverbs emerge from oral<br> 
            tradition, faith, and everyday social practices, making them interpretive<br> 
            rather than fixed. When translated literally, they often become imprecise<br> 
            or distorted; when translated functionally, they risk losing their emotional<br> 
            weight and cultural specificity. This creates ambiguity, multiple<br> 
            interpretations, and non-equivalence, rendering some proverbs effectively<br> 
            untranslatable. What remains is a fragmented version of the original—technically<br> 
            accurate, yet detached from the lived experience that gives the proverb its power.

            I am Egyptian and I was born and raised in Qatar. I grew up speaking Arabic<br>
            and English, sometimes mixing in different languages when speaking with family<br>
            and friends. I never had a problem with expressing what I want to say. I always<br>
            felt in ease when switching from one language to another until I came to the US.<br>
            I realized that there is a lot that I cant say to any non-arabic speaker unless I<br>
            take a couple of miuntes to think about the right words to use while translating<br>
            and I slowly realized its always the Arabic proverbs.<br>

            One day, I came across Yamine Daaboul's work on Instagram. Yamine is a British-Syrian<br>
            artist based in London. Her series "in Arabic we say" celebrates the beauty of everyday<br>
            Arabic expressions: from blessings to words of welcome painted by hand on limited-edition<br>
            plates. "A tribute to Language, culture and true epitome of love" she says.
        </p>

        <p> This is the list of Arabic phrases that Yamine chose for her work: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>انتي قمر</li>
            <li>تصبح على خير</li>
            <li>ليله سعيده</li>
            <li>في الدنيا و الآخره</li>
            <li>سفره دائمه</li>
            <li>اهلا و سهلاً</li>
            <li>نورتونا</li>
            <li>البيت بيتك</li>
            <li>نعيما</li>
            <li>عيونك الحلوين</li>
        </ul>
