        <p>It’s important to keep all files related to a website in the same folder. Try to develop an organizational system that won’t change much and can be scaled as needed. This will help with locating files as the website grows and will prevent references to files (like webpages and images) from breaking when you re-organize things. Don't stress too much about this early on — over time you will develop a personal sense of organization.</p>
